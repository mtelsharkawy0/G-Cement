<h1>A NEW ERA OF RECYCLED BUILDING MATERIALS</h1>
<p>
At G-Cement, we convert plastic waste into environmentally-friendly, durable, recyclable, and more economic building materials. With our scalable solution, no need to use fossil fuel to produce cement-based building materials, while saving the environment from pollutions of burning and dumping plastic waste. 
By reusing plastic waste, we add a strong tie towards plastic circular economy. By producing recyclable, clean, and economic building materials, we close the loop in the complex and linear building materials economy. With G-Cement, building sustainable communities is a reality!
